(* We need to be careful about the order in which we instantiate a
   type hierarchy with an overloaded method whose argument type
   mentions a subclass.  This is extracted from the FingerTree code.
   We see the following instantiation work (R indicates completion).
   Note that nested instantiations of a type will return the
   partially-computed outer object, and the problem is we need to know
   the extends list in order to check the validity of the addLeft
   overloading.
