Figure~\ref{fig:values} gives conventional grammars for redexes (a subset of expressions that are subject to evaluation reduction),
values (expressions that contain no redexes), and evaluation contexts.  It also defines how to compute the ilk of a value.
The notation $\listof{\arrowtype{\alpha}{\omega}}$ is the type of functions that produce a value of type $\omega$ when
given an argument of type $\alpha$ \emph{and} furthermore go wrong (````get stuck'') when given an argument that is not
of type $\alpha$.

Figure~\ref{fig:evaluation} gives rules for reducing an expression to a value.
We use the conventional notation $[\bar{X/\Id}]Y$ to indicate a copy of $Y$
modified by simultaneous substitution of a copy of $X_1$ for each occurrence of $\Id_1$,
a copy of $X_2$ for each occurrence of $\Id_2$, and so on.
We use the conventional notation $E[e]$ to mean an evaluation context with its ````hole''
replaced by the expression $e$ (that is, $[e/\Box]E$).

Figure~\ref{fig:msa} gives rules for determining which is the most specific applicable
function or method for a given tuple of argument types.

In Welterweight Fortress there are three kinds of values: 
objects, functions, and tuples;
every object belongs to at least one constructed type,
every function belongs to at least one arrow type,
and every tuple belongs to at least one tuple type.
No value belongs to $\Bottom$.

Although a value may belong to more than one type, 
every value $v$ belongs to a unique type $\mathit{ilk}(v)$
(the \emph{ilk} of the value).
For every type $\alpha$,
if $v$ belongs to $\alpha$ then $\mathit{ilk}(v)$ is a subtype of $\alpha$.
(This notion of \emph{ilk} corresponds to what is sometimes called the
````class'' or ````run-time type'' of the value.\footnote{%
We prefer the term ````ilk'' to ````run-time type'' 
because the notion---and usefulness---of 
the most specific type to which a value belongs 
is not confined to run time.})

The implementation significance of ilks is that it is possible to
select the dynamically most specific applicable function
from an overload set using only the ilks of the argument values; no
other information about the arguments is needed.

If the type system is sound, then
if an expression is determined by the type system to have type $\alpha$,
then every value computed by the expression at run time
will belong to type $\alpha$;
moreover, 
whenever a function whose ilk is $\listof{\arrowtype{\alpha}{\omega}}$ is applied to an argument value,
then the argument value must belong to type $\alpha$, and whenever a function or method is invoked,
the argument values will belong to the types of the corresponding parameters.
