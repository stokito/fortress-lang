Figure~\ref{fig:internalsymbols} gives a grammar for symbols that do not appear in the concrete grammar
of Figure~\ref{fig:grammar} but are used in later figures.

Figure~\ref{fig:wellformedtypes} gives rules for deciding whether a type is well-formed, given a set of declarations $\Delta$.

Figure~\ref{fig:expressiontypes} gives rules for determining the static type of an expression, given a set of declarations $\Delta$ and a variable-type environment $\Gamma$.

\input{fig-wellformeddecls}

Figure~\ref{fig:wellformeddecls} gives rules for deciding whether declarations are well-formed and well-typed, given the overall set of declarations $\Delta$,
and for determining the type of a program.

\input{fig-miscjudgments}

Figure~\ref{fig:miscjudgments} gives rules for miscellaneous subsidary judgments.

The rules for typing and well-formedness depend on judgments about subtyping and type exclusion, which are addressed in Section~\ref{sec:subtyping}.
